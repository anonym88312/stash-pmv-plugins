# PMV Generator

Pick a song – on every beat it cuts to a clip from your Stash library: split-screen layouts like real PMVs, effects on cuts, beats and drops, beat-synced speed ramps and clip audio. It runs live in the browser and can record the result as a video and save it back to Stash as a scene. It can also analyze an existing PMV and rebuild it with your own clips.

Works with classic Stash and with the **Stash UI** plugin: with Stash UI installed, the generator shows up in its menu under **Watch**, and its back link and saved scenes lead back into Stash UI.

## Using it

Open it with the **PMV** button in the Stash navbar, from **Watch → PMV Generator** in Stash UI, or directly at `/plugin/pmvGenerator/assets/index.html`. Three steps on the left; on the right the **Go** card with a summary of all settings and the start button (on narrow screens it sticks to the bottom). Every function is its own row with a switch and a short explanation.

1. **Music**: drop or choose a song (MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC). Tempo and beats are detected in the browser (under 1 s per minute of music). The waveform shows loudness and bars; if the tempo is off, **½ tempo** / **2× tempo** help, and **Earlier** / **Later** shift the cuts by 20 ms. **Music from a video**: drop a video instead of a song, or open **Music from a video in your library**, pick a scene and the part with the song (from/to) – ffmpeg cuts the sound out on the Stash computer (optionally also kept as a file in “PMV Generator/Songs”). Stash UI's player has the same as **Music → Open in PMV Generator**. **Only use … Cut** takes just a part of any song. **Long DJ mixes** (over 45 minutes, MP3 or WAV) work too: they're read piece by piece (with a progress display), the tempo is found per two-minute stretch, and the mix plays streamed from the file. **Several songs**: drop or choose several files (or a whole folder) – the show plays them one after another, optionally shuffled. Or take the music from **Plex**, listen live to **Spotify or another app**, or use **PMV as template** (all below).
2. **Clips**
   - **Clips from**: these filters, **a playlist** – one of Stash UI's smart playlists (e.g. “never watched, 4 stars and up”) decides which clips come – or a remix of your favorites: **Versus top** (the scenes that won their place in Versus, with their best moments) or **Most watched** (the last 30 days).
   - **What**: scenes, images, both – or **markers** (every clip starts at one of your markers; the tag filter then looks at the marker's tags, with sub-tags counted unless you switch that off) · **Clip shape**: all, portrait only, landscape only · include/exclude **tags** (right-click) – with several tags **all of them** or **any of them** · **performers** (all or any) · **Favorites only**.
   - **Tag stages that follow the song**: instead of one tag filter, list tags in order (A → B → C … up to five stages, each with its own include/exclude tags). The song is divided among the stages; the **last stage** plays on every drop and in the finale (the last tenth). The count shows the number of clips per stage; a stage without clips borrows from the others. Not for Plex/live music or templates.
   - **Rating at least**, **scenes at least** (1 / 5 / 20 min) and **resolution up to** 720p / 1080p / 1440p – lower resolutions run smoother.
   - **Folders**: a collapsible folder tree (searchable, with video/image counts); subfolders are included. Tick a folder to take it, **⊘** leaves a folder out (with its subfolders); every mark stands on its own and the deepest one wins – so you can leave a folder out and take one of its subfolders back, take a folder and leave a subfolder out, or take just a subfolder. A chip above the list goes away with a click. Without a choice: all folders.
   - **Clip selection** (one switch each):
     - **Best moments instead of random**: with Stash's scrubber thumbnails (sprites) all of a scene's ~80 pictures are rated for skin and contrast without touching the video, your markers get a bonus, and the best two are checked for motion; without sprites, markers and random spots are examined. Videos above 1440p skip the motion check – every jump in a 4K video costs. Short clips (under 10 s) start at the beginning. The clips also follow the music: calm parts of the song get the calmer clips, loud parts and drops the ones where the most is going on (measured picture motion; scenes with a funscript also count how fast it is at that spot). A scene's recently used spots are avoided, so the same few moments don't come up again and again. (Thanks to PepegaSan.)
     - **Smart crop**: when a clip has to be cropped, the crop follows what matters in the picture (skin, edges) instead of sticking to the center; re-measured every 0.4 s and smoothly followed.
     - **Match cuts**: at each cut, the ready clip that best matches the outgoing one in color, brightness and composition (where the subject sits) comes next.
     - **Clean cuts** (with best moments): a clip starts where its scene runs on for the next few seconds – spots with a hidden scene change inside (the clip would jump to another scene by itself) are passed over, a few more spots are tried first.
     - **Follow the scenes' timeline** (off by default; needs a song of known length): a clip is taken from the part of its scene that matches how far the song is – the start of the song uses the beginnings of the scenes, the end of the song their endings (a window of about ±12 % of the scene around that spot; best moments and markers only count inside it).
     - **Clip speed follows the music** (experimental, off by default): fast, busy music gets clips with fast motion, calm music slow ones. The scene is picked for its speed (of the next 24 in line), then the spot in it; speed maps come from Stash's scene previews and from the spots measured while clips are prepared – they are kept in the browser (IndexedDB) between shows, so the next show already knows them.
     - **Motion on the beat** (experimental, off by default): the rhythm of the motion in each clip is measured and lined up with the beat – a clip comes in on a turn of the motion and plays up to 12 % faster or slower, trimmed once per beat so it stays there. Works best with steady, repeating motion and a still camera.
     - **Mouse control** (its own section between Sound and Funscript; all off by default): click the middle = play / pause, middle mouse button = new clips (R), click the left / right side = off / next-previous song / song volume (5 % per click; reversible), mouse wheel = off / next-previous song / song volume (reversible). **Start by itself** (Output → Title cards: opens the show as soon as it can – Plex playlist set, or right after picking a song).
     - **Skip the start / the end of each scene** (Clip selection, two sliders, 0–300 s): no clip comes from those seconds – a studio logo, the credits. On top of the automatic intro skip below. Off by default.
     - **No intros**: picked spots (best moments, speed maps, random) start after a scene's intro (3 min → 15 s, 10 min → 24 s, longer → 30 s; your markers are not affected), and a clip that reaches its scene's end turns back to its own start instead of looping into the intro.
     - **Variety**: the same scene doesn't come back within the last 24 clips, the same performer preferably not within the last 4 (with a small selection it eventually can't be avoided).
3. **Style** – at the top the **mood** (*PMV classic*, *Maximal*, *Hypno*, *Clean* set cutting, layouts and effects in one go), below five sections – all open; click a section's header to collapse it, or use **Collapse all**:
   - **Reveal opening** (off by default; songs of known length, not with templates): the first clip sits in the middle of the picture as a cut-out window in its own shape (a portrait clip stands upright) – rounded corners, black all around, a soft glow that breathes with the beat – and slowly grows – one single clip, no cuts until the drop; at the first drop (else after 32 beats) it opens up into the layouts you chose – with the drop's flash and effects.
   - **Scrolling sides** (off by default; needs the 3-way layouts): in a 3-way layout the middle clip stays for four bars while the clips at the sides scroll – out at the top and in from the bottom, or the other way round (chosen per phase), like swiping through a feed. Not on drops and not in the loudest parts.
   - **Pictures** (Style → Pictures, both off by default; needs images in Stash): still images from your library on top of the clips, in a tempo of their own. **Image flash** covers the clips for a moment – one picture or a burst, 1, 2, 4 or 8 per beat (or following the song: calm parts 1, loud parts 4), how often and how long a burst lasts are set. **Image overlay** lays a see-through picture over the playing clips for a few beats (opacity, length and how often are set). Both can use their own tags and performers (none picked = all images). The pictures are fetched in batches and shrunk to 1600 px, so they stay light. Only tested against a mock Stash.
   - **Funscript** (Funscript section; off by default): a funscript built from the song – beats become strokes, energy decides how fast and how big – played on The Handy together with the show (needs the connection key from Stash UI → Settings → Interactive; your own song files, not Plex or a live app). Pace, stroke size, where on the stroke, sharp or smooth, gentle calm parts, accents, top speed. “Save funscript” on the end card downloads it.
   - **Cutting**: **Bars and phrases** finds the “one” of each bar and where a 4-bar phrase starts (a song with a pickup or a short intro breaks “every 4th beat”): cuts sit on the bar grid (every beat, beats 1 and 3, or the “one”), split screens change at the start of a phrase. Not for live music, templates or very long files · automatic by energy (calm every 4 beats, medium every 2, loud every beat) or fixed · **Layouts** (split screens like in real PMVs): fullscreen, kaleidoscope, 2-way, **3-way mirrored** (the same clip mirrored left and right, a different one in the middle), 3-way, 4-way. Calm parts stay fullscreen, loud parts switch between the 3-way layouts, drops jump straight into many fields; narrow fields prefer portrait clips · **Fields in 2-/3-way layouts**: side by side or stacked.
   - **Pace** (for Automatic cuts): *Slow* (calm every 8 beats · medium every 4 · loud every 2), *Normal* (4 · 2 · 1) or *Fast* (2 · 1 · 1) – is the PMV slow or fast paced.
   - **Zoom pulse** is smoother now: it eases in just before the beat (the next beat is known), peaks exactly on it and fades out softly. *Strength* sets how far it zooms, and it can pump on **every beat**, **every 2nd** or only **each bar**.
   - **Look & picture**: **Color look** now has a *strength* (a light pink or blue breath instead of a full tint) and **Own color** with a color picker; **Brightness** lifts the mid-tones smoothly (soft-light, no burnt highlights); **Rim of the picture** blurs (*Blur*), smears (*Motion*: sideways at the left and right edge, up and down at the top and bottom) or bends (*Lens*) only the edges while the middle stays sharp; **Smooth scaling** (on by default) scales the clips with the best quality for less pixelated pictures.
   - **Cut ahead of the beat** (Cutting → Timing, 0–80 ms, off by default): the cut is made a little before the beat (2 frames are about 33 ms), so the new picture is already there when the beat hits – it feels tighter. The zoom pulse still sits exactly on the beat.
   - **Main tags** (What → Main tags): tags every clip must have, e.g. a model – the normal Tags only count together with them, also with “Any of the tags”. (By PepegaSan.)
   - **Shortest clip / Longest clip** (Cutting → Timing, in beats, off by default): a clip stays on screen at least / at most that many beats before its field changes – no more clips that come and go on the very next beat. The shortest also holds back layout changes (also after a drop); the longest cuts a field whose clip has been on that long, whatever the pace says.
   - **New clips without stopping the music**: the shuffle button in the bar (or **R**) throws away the clips that are ready, starts the supply over with a fresh random order and – as soon as the first new clips are ready – changes every field at once; the song, the beats and the effects go on. With several songs or Plex, **New clips for every song** (Clip order) does that when the next song starts.
   - **Several songs**: **Again for every song** (Output → Title cards) shows intro and outro for each song (the outro when a song plays to its end; the clip count in it is per song), and **One video per song** (Output → Recording) cuts the recording into one video per song – the end card lists them, each one to download or save to Stash on its own.
   - **Change the moment** (**M**, or the pencil in the bar): the show pauses and each clip of a scene on screen gets a slider and step buttons to take it from another moment of its scene; *Pin this moment* keeps it – clips of that scene then often start there.
   - **Marker clips** stay inside their marker when it has an end (they loop there instead of playing on into the rest of the scene). The clip info (**I**) shows each clip's tags and – with tag stages – its stage, so you can see what the stages really picked. “Follow the scenes' timeline” is hidden for Markers and Images (it has no effect there). Tag stages need your own song (a known length): with Plex, a live app or a PMV template the tags of all stages count together instead (and a message says so) – before, no tag filter applied at all there.
   - **Divider width** (Picture & frame → Seams and edges, 1–8 px at 1280 wide, 2 px by default): how thick the lines between the fields of a split screen are; it scales with the picture size. Not used with soft seams.
   - **Soft seams** (Look → *Soften the seams*, off by default): in a split screen the line between two fields is no longer sharp – it is smeared softly (nothing overlaps, each clip stays in its own field). *Softness* sets how wide the soft band is (a narrow band, at most 8 % of the narrowest field). Only a narrow band across each seam is touched, so it costs hardly anything.
   - **Fit** keeps the whole clip with blurred bars – but a clip whose shape is only a little off the field's (up to ~16 %) simply fills the field, a few percent cropped, so there are no thin bars that the zoom pulse covers and uncovers.
   - **Effects**, grouped by occasion, each group with “All on/off” (on by default: zoom-in entry, flash, zoom pulse, RGB split):
     - *On cuts*: transitions (motion blur), zoom-in entry, flash
     - *On the beat*: zoom pulse, shake, **speed ramps** (slow motion in calm parts, faster in loud ones, a burst on drops), stutter, strobe (off by default – careful if you are sensitive to light)
     - *On drops*: RGB split, glitch, tunnel, negative, echo, **text** (your own words in SFX style)
   - **Look & picture**: **color look** for all clips – Original, Warm, Pink, Cold, Vivid, Black & white, Noir · **Even out brightness** (clips that are too dark get brightened, too bright ones toned down) · color rush, VHS, **image drift** (Ken Burns on still images), **glowing dividers** · format 16:9 or 9:16 · **Fit** (default: the whole clip, with a blurred border) or **Fill** (crops the clip to fill the field).
   - **Sound**: sliders for the volume of the **song** and the **clips** (0–100 % each) · **clip audio** on/off · **clip audio plays** *only on drops* (the original audio of the biggest clip fades in for a few beats, like the voice-overs in real PMVs) or *always* (all visible clips play audibly under the song; in split screens they share the clip volume). Everything ends up in the recording exactly like this.
   - **Output**: **intro** (your title slams in on a pink hatched bar, ~3 s) and **outro** (the picture fades dark, title and number of clips, the last second black); title of your choice, empty = song name · **Record** in 720p or 1080p.
4. **Go**: with **Record** on the video is recorded **while the show plays**, in real time – let it run to the end; Stop / Esc ends the file at that point (the end card says how far it got). Clips that can't be played are skipped; when nothing plays at all, the error lists the clips that were tried and why. Black clips are most often a codec the browser can't decode (HEVC / H.265, AV1 …): re-encoding to H.264 helps, and so does generating previews and sprites in Stash (Tasks → Generate).
   Runs as a fullscreen show (Space pause, F fullscreen, Esc stop; with several songs N / P or the buttons in the bar skip, and shuffle can be switched there too). The bar at the top and the mouse pointer disappear after 2.5 s without moving the mouse; **H** hides the bar for good. **I** shows which clips are on screen (name, file, size, state) and which had to be skipped and why – e.g. a video the browser can't decode is left out instead of showing a black field, and a clip that fails during the show is replaced. **My settings** saves everything about clips, cutting, effects, look and sound under a name, loads it again, and exports/imports it as a file. Saved settings are kept in Stash (the plugin's settings), so they're there in every browser. The bar at the top lets you adjust the sound live: sliders for **song** and **clips**, and the button next to them cycles clip audio through *off → on drops → always*. This applies right away (including the recording) and is remembered for the next show. With **Record** you get a video (WebM): preview, **Download** or **Save to Stash** – it lands in `<first video library>/PMV Generator`, gets scanned and receives the title “PMV – song” and the tag “PMV Generator”.

**Format and window**: the picture is 16:9, 9:16 or **Match window** – it takes the shape of your window (an ultrawide or a tall window too) and follows when you resize it while it runs (not while recording, a video can't change its size). **In the window**: *Show all* (bars where the shapes differ), *Fill the window* (the edges are cut off) or *Stretch*.

Tip: three full-size portrait clips side by side = format **16:9** + layout 3-way + “Portrait only” (each column is then almost exactly 9:16).

## RedGifs (optional)

Step 2 → **RedGifs** – the same source as in Media Storm:

- **Share**: what percentage of the clips comes from RedGifs (0 = off, the default; 100 = RedGifs only). The rest comes from your library; if one side runs out or RedGifs can't be reached, the other fills in.
- **Niches, tags & creators**: type in the search field → live suggestions in three groups (with clip count and subscribers/followers). Click or Enter adds them as a chip (pink = niche, purple = tag, blue = creator), × removes. Several are possible; one is picked at random per fetch. Without a choice you get trending.
- **Creator with tags**: adding a creator (or clicking its chip) opens the tags they actually use (most used first, with counts) – pick some to get only their clips with those tags; with two or more choose **All of the tags** or **Any of the tags**. A hint shows how many of their latest clips fit. No tag picked = all of their clips. (Thanks to PepegaSan.)
- **Sort order** (trending, top of the week/month/all time, latest) and **quality** (SD/HD).
- Clip shape and “scenes/images” apply to RedGifs clips too; best moments, smart crop, match cuts and the recording work with them as well.

### Saving RedGifs clips to Stash

- During the show: **D** or **Save clip** in the top bar saves the RedGifs clips that are on screen.
- On the end card: **Save the N RedGifs clips** saves every RedGifs clip used in this PMV.
- Always saved in **HD** as `creator_id.mp4`. Save location: default `<first Stash library>/RedGifs`, subfolders **by source** (niche, tag or creator – `Trending` without a choice), **by the clip's creator** or **everything in one folder**.
- Stash then scans just this folder and the new scene gets the RedGifs link, a title, the description and the tag **RedGifs**. Files that already exist aren't downloaded twice.

Technical notes: the page talks to the RedGifs API directly when Stash is opened via `localhost`; opened via its network address, the browser isn't allowed to, so the requests go through the plugin backend (`rgbackend.py`, shared with Media Storm – needs `python` in the PATH). Downloads only come from `media.redgifs.com`.

## Music from Plex

Switch step 1 to **Plex** and **Sign in with Plex** – you confirm on plex.tv like with any Plex app (no password passes through the generator, the key stays in this browser). With one server it's picked right away, otherwise you choose. Then:

- **Follow what's playing**: the generator becomes a visualizer for whatever you play in Plex – Plexamp, your phone, the Plex web app, a TV. The sound stays in your Plex player; the show only brings the pictures and follows along: the next song (its beats are detected as soon as it starts), pause, seeking. Players report their position only every few seconds; the generator keeps the tightest estimate from all reports, so it settles within a few seconds. What it can't know is how late your speakers are (Bluetooth, TV, AV receiver): press **T** (or **Tap** in the bar) along to the beat you hear – after four taps the offset sets itself, tap on to refine. **− / +** (or **[ / ]**) shift the cuts by hand in 50 ms steps. The offset is remembered per Plex player. Nothing is recorded in this mode.
- **A playlist**: one of your Plex music playlists, in order or shuffled – played here, like several songs of your own.
- **Shuffle all**: random songs from all your music libraries.

The browser talks to plex.tv and to your server directly. Stash on `http://localhost` can reach your server in the local network; on a `https` page (e.g. the web version) only a server reachable over https works (Plex's secure connections or Remote Access).

## Spotify & other apps (live)

Switch step 1 to **Spotify & apps**. The generator listens to one program on this PC – Spotify by default, any other by its name as in the Task Manager (TIDAL, foobar2000, a browser …) – and cuts on the hits you hear – kick and snare, not the hi-hats – about when your speakers play them, at most about once per beat (the tempo is measured along the way). There's no guessed beat grid: in trap, hip-hop or phonk the hits sit on thirds of the beat and a predicted grid keeps slipping; this way every cut lands on a real hit. Calm parts without clear hits get a quiet cut every few seconds instead of pumping on nothing. A new song, pause and skipping are followed. Only that program is heard – a game, Discord or anything else running at the same time stays out. You play music in the app as usual; the song title comes from Spotify's window. Nothing is recorded in this mode.

- If your speakers are late (Bluetooth, TV), the cuts come early: tap **T** along to the beat or use **−** / **[** – remembered per app.
- How it works: the plugin's backend compiles a small helper (`applisten.cs`) once with the C# compiler that comes with Windows and starts it. It uses Windows' per-app audio capture and hands only that app's sound to this page, on `127.0.0.1` with a secret key; it stops by itself when nobody listens for 90 s (one helper per app).
- Needs Stash on **Windows 11** (or Windows 10 from 2022) and the browser on the same computer.

## PMV as template

Switch step 1 to **PMV as template**, then pick a PMV from your library (without a search, scenes tagged “PMV” are listed first) or a video file. The analysis runs in the browser at about three times real-time speed:

- **Music** comes from the video's audio track, plus tempo and beats.
- **Cuts**: where the picture changes abruptly – even in just one field of a split screen.
- **Layouts**: dividers running through almost every row (2-/3-/4-way), and exactly mirrored thirds (3-way mirrored) or quarters (kaleidoscope).
- **Flashes**: suddenly very bright frames (white or pink).

A timeline then shows the sections colored by layout (cuts on top, flashes at the bottom). **Rebuild with my clips** plays the original music with the same cuts, layouts and flashes – only with clips from your library (clip selection and effects as usual). Effects like glitch, RGB split or text are burned into the original and can't be recovered; your effects run at the same moments. Stutter jumps in the original are detected as cuts.

Needs a browser with `requestVideoFrameCallback` (Chrome, Edge, current Firefox) and a video the browser can play.

## Performance

Picture analysis (smart crop, even brightness, match cuts, best moments) shrinks the picture on the graphics card and reads it back in a background thread, so even 4K60 clips don't stall the page; at most three clips are prepared at once. If it still stutters, **Resolution up to 1080p** is the biggest lever.

**Browser and codecs**: the clips are decoded by your browser, so what it can decode in hardware decides how smooth it is. Plain H.264 (not HEVC/H.265) runs with very little CPU; HEVC, AV1 and 4K are decoded in software and are much heavier – especially with many clips open at once or files on a NAS. Chrome and Firefox are recommended; Safari on macOS has been seen to lag with 15–20 clips open while Chrome played the same setup smoothly.

## Requirements

- A current Chrome, Edge or Firefox.
- Saving to Stash and saving RedGifs clips use the small backend `backend.py` (needs `python` in the PATH). With ffmpeg (Stash's own or from the PATH) the recording is remuxed without re-encoding so duration and seeking work – browser recordings otherwise carry no duration.

## Languages

English, **Simplified Chinese (简体中文)**, **Japanese (日本語)**, **Vietnamese (Tiếng Việt)**, **French (Français)**, **Spanish (Español)**, **German (Deutsch)** and **Polish (Polski)**. The language follows Stash UI's choice (Settings → General → Language); on “Automatic” it follows the interface language set in Stash.
